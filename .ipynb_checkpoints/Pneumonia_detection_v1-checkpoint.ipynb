    "**Basics of Building a Neural Network with Keras:**\n",
    "1. **Import required modules**\n",
    "    - **For general neural network**\n",
    "        - `from keras import models, layers,optimizers`\n",
    "    - **For text:**\n",
    "        - `from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer`\n",
    "        - `from keras.utils import to_categorical`\n",
    "    - **For images:**\n",
    "        - `from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, img_to_array, array_to_img`\n",
    "    - **For relocating image files:**\n",
    "        - `import os, shutil`\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. **Decide on a network architecture (have only discussed sequential thus far)**\n",
    "    - `model = models.Sequential()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adding layers - specifying layer type, number of neurons, activation functions, and, optionally, the input shape.**\n",
    "    - `model.add(layers.Dense(units, activation='relu', input_shape))`\n",
    "    - `model.add(layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')`\n",
    "    - **3B. Final layer choice:**\n",
    "        - Want to have as many neurons as classes you are trying to predict\n",
    "        -  Final activation function:\n",
    "            - For binary classificaiton, use `activation='sigmoid'`\n",
    "            - For multi classificaiton, use `activation='softmax'`\n",
    "        - For regression tasks, have a single final neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training the model**\n",
    "    - `model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20,batch_size=512,validation_data=(x_val,y_val))`\n",
    "        - Note: if using images with ImageDataGenerator, use `model.fit_generator()`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **batches:**\n",
    "        - a set of N samples, processed independently in parallel\n",
    "        - a batch determines how many samples are fed through before back-propagation. \n",
    "        - model only updates after a batch is complete.\n",
    "        - ideally have as large of a batch as your hardware can handle without going out of memory.\n",
    "            - larger batches usually run faster than smaller ones for evaluation/prediction. \n",
    "    - **epoch:**\n",
    "        - arbitrary cutoff / \"one pass over the entire dataset\", useful for logging and periodic evaluation\n",
    "        - when using kera's `model.fit` parameters `validation_data` or `validation_split`, these evaluations run at the end of every epoch.\n",
    "        - Within Keras can add callbacksto be run at the end of an epoch. Examples of these are learning rate changes and model checkpointing (saving).\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluation / Predictions**\n",
    "    - To get predicted results:\n",
    "        - `y_hat_test = model.predict(test)`\n",
    "    - To get evaluation metrics:\n",
    "        - `results_test = model.evaluate(test, label_test)`\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "7. **Visualization**\n",
    "    - **`history =  model.fit()` creates history object with .history attribute.**\n",
    "        - `history.history()` returns a dictionary of metrics from each epoch. \n",
    "            - `history.history['loss']` and `history.history['acc']` \n",
    "            \n",
    "### ðŸ’¡ Data Augmentation (not covered in class)\n",
    "- Simplest way to reduce overfitting is to increase the size of the training data.\n",
    "- Difficult to do with large datasets, but can be implemented with images as shown below:\n",
    "- **For augmenting image data:**\n",
    "    - Can alter the images already present in the training data by shifting, shearing, scaling, rotating.<br><br> <img src =\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/9i1hl3quwo294jr/data_augmentation_example.png?raw=1\" width=300>\n",
    "    - This usually provides a big leap in improving the accuracy of the model. It can be considered as a mandatory trick in order to improve our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In Keras:**\n",
    "    - `ImageDataGenerator` contains several augmentations available.\n",
    "    - Example below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n",
    "datagen = ImageDataGenerator(horizontal flip=True)\n",
    "datagen.fit(train)\n",
    " "
